# Survivable Engine

An object-oriented rebuild of [Everlost Isle](https://cubee.games/?rel=games&sub=everlost_isle)'s engine, which was originally internally known as Survive. 
Built on Monogame 3.8.1 in Visual Studio 2022.

Everlost Isle is intended to become a top-down survival game, largely inspired by Terraria's progression style and Stardew Valley's world structure and perspective, though I intend to build the engine separately from the game's content in a way that can allow easy modding and potentially entirely new games to be built on it.
I've decided to put my early experiments up here for people to see what I'm up to, and if I do something stupid or miss something obvious, hopefully someone can help me out :)
